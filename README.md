# procedural programming

### What is procedural programming?
Procedural works on data types and edits that data type. logic and data types are seperate. this is different from Object oriented where Logic and data go hand in hand. if you seperate the data and the logic it is easier to test to see if the logic works and you can separately test if the data is valid.

# Is my code procedural programming?
yes
# Prove it.
```C
struct Vec{
	double x;
	double y;
} typedef Vec;
```
in the above example we have a struct. you cant preform oporations using any form of . meathod syntax like in java or python you must pass it to functions
